# CypherEstate
#### What is CypherEstate?

>CypherEstate is a decentralized blogging site based on IPFS. Users can create their own personal blog, free of charge, and post anything they have in mind. No censorship, no moderation. Neither CypherEstate nor government agencies can remove what has been posted on the platform.

#### Why CypherEstate?

>The rise of the internet marked the start of the information era. Emphasis on information. We believe anyone should be free to express their ideas, regardless of their point of view. Traditional journaling sites are becoming increasingly restrictive, submitting to political and corporate pressure.

#### Who are we?

>We are Pol Baladas, Eric Alcaide and Oscar Cuatrecasas, students from the Data Science and Engineering degree at Polytechnic University of Catalonia.

#### Born in Barcelona.

>This project was born at the HackUPC Fall event of 2017. We launched the first version of the platform after 36 hours of intensive programming. The Polytechnic University of Catalonia and Major League Hacking provided us with a friendly development environment that enhanced creativity and teamwork. We are extremely grateful for all the work the organizers, sponsors and volunteers put into the hackathon.

## Future

CypherEstate won the [Everis](https://www.everis.com/spain/es) hackathon prize for best blockchain hack/product to have a potentially meaningful impact in society.

As of January 2018, CypherEstate is joining the [FileNation](https://github.com/FileNation/) project to add publishing and text-based features to the rapidly growing and exciting decentralized WeTransfer alternative.
